# Document Question-Answering System

## Overview
This project is a Document Question-Answering System developed using Langchain, leveraging the capabilities of OpenAI's embeddings for vector generation, and utilizing AstraDB for efficient similarity searches. The system aims to provide accurate and quick answers to questions based on the content of provided documents.

## Features
- **Langchain Integration**: Utilized Langchain to streamline the development of the NLP pipeline.
- **OpenAI Embeddings**: Implemented OpenAI embeddings for generating high-quality vector representations of documents.
- **Vector Database**: Used AstraDB for its real-time and efficient similarity-search capabilities.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large datasets and deliver quick responses.
- **Modularity**: Built with modular components to allow easy updates and maintenance.

## Technologies Used
- **Langchain**: For chaining together NLP components.
- **OpenAI**: For embeddings and language models.
- **AstraDB**: As the vector database for efficient searches.
- **Python**: Primary programming language used.
